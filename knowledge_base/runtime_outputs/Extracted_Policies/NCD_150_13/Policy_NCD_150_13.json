    "description": "Percutaneous Image-Guided Lumbar Decompression (PILD) is a posterior decompression of the lumbar spine performed under indirect image guidance for symptomatic Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS) unresponsive to conservative therapy. PILD is covered by Medicare through Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) when beneficiaries with LSS are enrolled in an approved clinical study that meets specific criteria. Coverage criteria are split into two sections: Section I for prospective, randomized, controlled studies (effective January 9, 2014) and Section II for prospective, longitudinal studies using FDA-approved/cleared devices that completed a CMS-approved Randomized Control Trial (RCT) from Section I (effective December 7, 2016). PILD for LSS is not considered reasonable and necessary outside the context of a clinical trial.",
