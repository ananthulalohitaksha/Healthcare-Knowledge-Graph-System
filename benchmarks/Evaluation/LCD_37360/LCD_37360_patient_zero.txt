Medical Record - L37360_001 file:///Users/sanjana/Desktop/CMS_arizona/SYN_data/L37360/pns_record_001.html
Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor strength 5/5 all extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. Reflexes 2+ and symmetric. Negative Tinel's sign at occipital nerves bilaterally.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES MRI Brain and Cervical Spine (08/12/2024): No acute intracranial abnormality. Mild degenerative
changes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 without significant stenosis or nerve root compression.
EMG/NCS Upper Extremities (07/20/2024): No evidence of cervical radiculopathy or peripheral neuropathy.
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION | Date: August 28, 2024 | Evaluator: Dr. Sarah Chen, Licensed Clinical Psychologist Summary: Ms. Richardson underwent comprehensive psychological evaluation including clinical
interview and standardized assessment tools (BDI-II, BAI, Pain Catastrophizing Scale). She demonstrates appropriate coping mechanisms and realistic expectations regarding neuromodulation
therapy. No significant depression currently present (BDI-II score: 12). Anxiety symptoms are mild and well-managed (BAI score: 14). No evidence of substance abuse or misuse of prescribed
medications. She has strong social support and motivation for treatment. Cleared for peripheral nerve stimulation trial from psychological perspective.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN | Primary Diagnosis: G52.8 - Chronic bilateral occipital neuralgia
Secondary Diagnoses: G43.919 - Migraine, unspecified, intractable, without status migrainosus Ms. Richardson is a 56-year-old female with chronic, severe, intractable bilateral occipital neuralgia
and refractory migraines of 7 years duration. She has failed extensive conservative therapies including multiple medication trials, physical therapy, nerve blocks, and Botox injections. Pain significantly
impairs her functional capacity and quality of life.
After thorough discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, she has been deemed an appropriate candidate for a trial of occipital nerve stimulation. She has undergone psychological clearance and has
no contraindications to the procedure. Patient education has been provided regarding the trial process, expected outcomes, and potential complications. She demonstrates understanding and provides
informed consent.
Plan:

Medical Record - L37360_001 file:///Users/sanjana/Desktop/CMS_arizona/SYN_data/L37360/pns_record_001.html
Proceed with percutaneous trial placement of bilateral occipital nerve stimulator leads Trial period: 5-7 days | Patient to maintain detailed pain diary during trial
If trial demonstrates ≥50% pain reduction and functional improvement, proceed with permanent implantation | Follow-up appointment scheduled 10 days post-trial placement | PHYSICIAN ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION
Patient presents with chronic occipital neuralgia causing severe functional impairment. Conservative treatments have been exhausted without adequate relief. Occipital nerve stimulation trial is
recommended as next appropriate intervention.
Procedure Requested: CPT 64555 - Percutaneous implantation of neurostimulator electrode array;
peripheral nerve (bilateral occipital nerves) | Attending Physician: Robert J. Martinez, MD | Board Certification: Pain Medicine, Anesthesiology | NPI:

**Data Normalization Rules to consider during evaluation:**
- **Patient IDs (MRN):** An extracted ID should be considered correct if it represents the same number as the source document, even if formatting characters like dashes ('-') have been removed. For example, if the source says "123-456-7890", an extracted value of "1234567890" is correct.

Your task is to perform two steps:

Step 1: Count Discrepancies
True Positives (TP):
 Count every value in the extracted JSON that is correct and accurately reflects the information in the original patient medical record text.


False Positives (FP):
 Count every value in the extracted JSON that is incorrect, irrelevant, or not present in the original patient medical record text.


False Negatives (FN):
 Count every piece of relevant information in the original patient medical record text that was missed and is not present in the extracted JSON.



Step 2: Calculate Metrics
Precision: Calculate TP / (TP + FP)


Recall: Calculate TP / (TP + FN)


F1-Score: Calculate 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Output Format
Provide the final output in the following JSON format. Do not include any other text, explanations, or summaries.
{
  "counts": {
    "true_positives": <integer_count>,
    "false_positives": <integer_count>,
    "false_negatives": <integer_count>
  },
  "metrics": {

    "recall": <float_from_0.0_to_1.0>,
    "f1_score": <float_from_0.0_to_1.0>
